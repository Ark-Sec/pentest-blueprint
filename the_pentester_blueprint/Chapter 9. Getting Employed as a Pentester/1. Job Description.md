"Pentester" or "Ethical hacker" are not always listed as a job title. Human Resources uses similar titles across infosec roles as they do for IT roles. Having fewer titles to deal with makes it easier for HR to manage. 

Here are some common job titles that may involve pentesting responsibilities:

Infosec or Security Analyst 
Infosec or Security Engineer 
Infosec or Security Consultant 

When looking for pentesting jobs, you must review the job description. The terms “pentesting” or “ethical hacking” will typically be found there. Also look for “pentesting tools,” “techniques,” and “methodologies” in the job description. Nessus or Nexpose vulnerability scanners and web app pentesting tools like Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Web Inspect, and AppScan may also appear within the job description. Knowledge of the OWASP Top 10 Most Critical Application Security Risks is commonly sought, especially in web app pentesting jobs. Pentesting jobs can be found under offensive security, red team, threat and vulnerability management, or vulnerability management positions.
