As noted in the previous section, targeted use of social media can be very helpful in finding jobs and for your career in general. Focus on professional social media platforms, especially LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com/feed). Keep your LinkedIn profile up to date, as it is basically an online résumé. You can find many job listings on LinkedIn, and recruiters use it extensively to find qualified candidates for job openings that they are trying to fill. 

Twitter (twitter.com/explore) is a good place to learn from and network with infosec people. You can find a lot of good information on Twitter and LinkedIn, including information about industry conferences and webinars. Both are good platforms to find out about new pentesting tools and techniques.
