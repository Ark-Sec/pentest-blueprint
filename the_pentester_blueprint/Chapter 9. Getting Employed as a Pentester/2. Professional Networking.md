Professional networking can be helpful in finding a job. Doing this may give you the opportunity to present your résumé to the hiring manager, or at least someone who can get your résumé to the hiring manager or refer you. 

Pentesting jobs often come about because of referrals that result from work you've performed on other pentesting jobs. Sometimes, you will need to pass up on pentesting jobs that are offered to you as well for various reasons. People in the security community will often refer people that they know. 

Meetup.com (www.meetup.com) is a great place to find infosec-related meetups. These meetups can be educational in addition to being helpful at finding a job. Local DEFCON groups are great meetings for pentesters and aspiring pentesters. OWASP and ISSA chapters also present good networking opportunities. 

Industry conferences are another educational and networking opportunity. To get the best results, make sure to talk to other attendees. Some meetings will announce which companies are hiring and also list individuals seeking employment. Be sure take some business cards with you to such meetings and pass them out liberally.

Work on building your social media connections. Social networks platforms like LinkedIn and Twitter are great places to connect with infosec professionals and find job opportunities. They are also great ways to learn about tools, events, and educational opportunities.
