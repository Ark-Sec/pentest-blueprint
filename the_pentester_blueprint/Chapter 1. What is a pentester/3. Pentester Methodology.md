## Pentester Methodology

The following list contains some common industry-recognized pentesting
methodologies:

standard.org

Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM):

NIST 800-115 (National Institute of Standards and Technology):

OWASP Testing Guide (Open Web Application Security Project):

Of the pentest methodologies listed here, the OWASP Testing Guide focuses on
web application pentests and is the industry standard for those types of pentests.
The first three methods are widely used and referenced in books and courses,
and some organizations use a combination of these methodologies. Pentest
reports and SOWs often document the methodology and the tools used during
pentests.

The Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) contains the seven main
sections of a pentest, which cover all of the required steps of a pentest. Not only
does the PTES offer a comprehensive methodology, but PTES offers technical

guidelines at www.pentest-
standard.org/index.php/PTES_Technical_Guidelines.

## Pre-engagement Interactions
This is the planning phase, and it introduces the tools and techniques to be used
during the pentests. The scope of a pentest is defined during this phase, as well
as the cost, beginning and ending times, and allowed testing times. Pentesting
has the potential to cause outages, so testing times need to be agreed upon with
the client, and the hours for testing and start and end dates for the pentest should
be included in the SOW. Questionnaires are used to help define the scope of the
pentest and to plan it. The goals of the pentest should be discussed during this
phase, and understanding them is helpful in scoping a successful pentest. The
rules of engagement should be determined, which define how the pentest is to be
done.

## Intelligence Gathering
In this phase, intelligence is gathered on targets to discover vulnerabilities and
information that can be used to exploit the target. Information like operating
system (OS) and software versions are useful in determining if a target is
vulnerable and exploitable. Other types of intelligence gathering could require
finding out information about individuals, companies, and organizations through
the Internet. Intelligence gathering is also referred to as reconnaissance and
Open Source Intelligence (OSINT).

## Threat Modeling
Threat modeling is a process by which potential threats, such as software or OS
vulnerabilities, can be identified, enumerated, and prioritized—all from a
hypothetical attacker's point of view. The purpose of threat modeling in
pentesting is to provide a systematic analysis of the probable attacker's profile,
the most likely attack vectors, and the assets most desired by an attacker. This
information is used to attack the target. Threat modeling is especially important
on more complex targets, and can be more difficult and time-consuming.

## Vulnerability Analysis
Vulnerability analysis is the process of discovering flaws in systems and
applications that can be leveraged by an attacker. These flaws can range
anywhere from host and service misconfiguration to insecure application design.
Tools such as port and service scanners and vulnerability scanners are used to
discover vulnerabilities. The discovered vulnerabilities are validated to ensure
that they are truly vulnerable and not false positives, and then analyzed to verify
if they can be exploited. Note that not all vulnerabilities are exploitable, but they

should be included in the report. Vulnerabilities that are not exploitable at the
time of the pentest could exploited later if an exploit is developed.

## Exploitation
This phase of a pentest focuses solely on hacking vulnerable systems detected
during the vulnerability analysis phase of the pentest. There are many different
things that you could do in this phase, which will depend on what you're testing,
and the scope defined in your SOW. It can include using vulnerability scanners,
attempting attacks on web applications, trying to access areas of buildings where
outsiders aren't permitted, trying to fool human beings, and various other
activities that may be attempted by real cyberattackers. Occasionally, you may
have to use your imagination, but be sure only to try what is allowed according
to your contract! Chapter 5, “Building a Pentesting Lab,” will explain the many
actions you'll take in this phase in much greater detail.

## Post Exploitation
The purpose of this phase is to determine the value of the compromised system
and to maintain control for later use. The value of the system is determined by
the sensitivity of the data stored on it and its usefulness in further exploiting
other systems.

## Reporting
This phase of the pentest is where the results and findings are documented. The
pentest report should have an executive summary where the results are
communicated in language that can be understood by nontechnical staff. This
section of the report is important for explaining the results to management and
the various business lines of the organization. Information on vulnerabilities
should be documented, reporting on systems that were exploitable and providing
details and evidence of the exploitation. Screenshots and ample evidence should
be provided to show proof of the vulnerabilities and exploited systems.
Recommendations and remediation information, as well as risk ratings for
vulnerabilities, should also be contained in the report.
