## Pentests Described

Some of the most common reasons for pentests are as follows

* Discovering and remediating vulnerabilities in order to mitigate possible
   breaches.
* Regulatory compliance is a major driver for companies to conduct pentests.
   Of course, this should not be the only reason—security should be the main purpose. Nonetheless, Payment Card Industry-Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are two major regulations. They pertain to payment systems ranging from those seen in brick-and-mortar stores to those implemented in ecommerce.

Some areas that can benefit from an understanding of pentesting are as follows:
* Security operations center (SOC) analysts
* Network security analysts and engineers
* Digital forensics and incident response (DFIR)
* Purple teams (a collaboration of defensive and offensive security)
* Application security

The statement of work (SOW) should include verbiage giving pentesters
permission to perform the pentest. It is important that the pentest adhere to a
well-defined scope in order to prevent legal problems and customer

dissatisfaction. Such permission can also include a document referred to as a get-
out-of-jail-free card, which can offer legal protection if you make certain

mistakes within the scope defined by the SOW.
