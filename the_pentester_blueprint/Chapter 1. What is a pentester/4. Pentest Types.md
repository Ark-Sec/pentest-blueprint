## Pentest Types

When a pentest is performed, pentesters are provided with information on the
targets that they are testing. This target knowledge can range from minimal

information to a great deal of information. You might know absolutely nothing
about the system that you're testing, or you might be as familiar with your target
as a network administrator! Three main categories define the depth of
information provided:
* Black box: The target knowledge for this type of pentest is very limited. For a web application, it is typically just the URL of the application. In the case of a network pentest, it can be an IP address or list of IP addresses. In some cases, the pentester may only know the company name, and it is up to the pentester to use reconnaissance to discover IP addresses or URLs to assess. Black box pentests mimic a malicious hacker more than the other methods.
* White box: Also referred to as a crystal box pentest, in this type of pentest, the pentester is provided with a lot of detailed information on the target being tested. This information can include documents, diagrams, and the user credentials of different user permissions levels. You want to make sure that a normal user of the application cannot access administrative functions.
* Gray box: This type of target knowledge falls between black box and white box testing. Gray box pentests are the most common type of the three. The amount of knowledge that you'll have could be anywhere between the extremes of the ignorance of an outsider up to the familiarity of a network administrator. For instance, you might start with as much knowledge of the network as a company insider who doesn't work in the IT department.
