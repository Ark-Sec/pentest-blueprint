## Synonymous Terms and Types of Hackers

White hat hackers Ethical hackers (aka pentesters).

Gray hat hackers: Gray hats fall into a fuzzy area. Their intent is not
always malicious, but it is not always ethical either.

Black hat hackers: Their intent and purpose are illegal. Cyber criminals
fall into this category.

There are also commonly used terms for malicious hackers. Out of respect for
good hackers, it is advised that you use these terms rather than the generic term
“hacker”:
* Threat actor
* Cyber criminals
* Black hat hackers, or black hats for short

Another way that hacking is used is through hacktivism. Hacktivists are activists
that use their hacking skills to support social change, human rights, freedom of
speech, or environmental causes. These are still cyberattacks. Even though the
hacktivists' motivation may be to help a good cause, these activities are still
illegal.
