## Pentest Targets and Specializations
Some pentesters work in a variety
of areas, and some choose to specialize. Some areas where a pentester can
specialize are as follows:

* Generalist (network, Wi-Fi, and light web app)
* Application (web app, mobile, thick client, and cloud)
* Internet of Things (IoT)
* Industrial Control Systems (ICS)
* Hardware (including medical devices)
* Social engineering (people)
* Physical (buildings)
* Transportation (vehicles, airplanes)
* Red team (adversarial simulation)


### Generalist Pentesting
Generalist pentesting is a nonspecific category. Generalists perform pentests on
local area networks, and Wi-Fi networks and do some light web application
pentesting.

### Application Pentesting
Application pentesting includes thick client applications, web applications,
mobile applications, and cloud applications. Thick client applications are the
older application types mentioned in this section.

### Internet of Things (IoT)
According to Merriam-Webster Dictionary, the Internet of Things (IoT) is:
A system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital
machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique
identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring
human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.

### Industrial Control Systems (ICS)
Industrial control systems (ICS) are a similar technology to IoT, but they are
used to manage industrial equipment including supervisory control and data
acquisition (SCADA) and control systems for water treatment facilities and
energy production plants.

### Hardware and Medical Devices
Hardware and medical devices need to be assessed for security vulnerabilities, so pentests should be performed on these types of technologies. Hardware includes in this category in network devices, such as routers and switches, and medical devices.

### Social Engineering
Social engineering is a type of security assessment that targets the human
element. Very secure systems can be circumvented by hacking or social
engineering of people. Social engineering leverages the use of phishing emails to
collect information, or user credentials, or deliver malware to collect
information, log keystrokes, or remotely control the victim's computer.

### Physical Pentesting
Physical pentests target buildings and all types of facilities. If the facility is
breached, this puts people and information at risk. If threat actors can bypass physical controls, they have a better chance at getting physical access to computers or servers, and physical access to these systems puts them at higher jeopardy of exploitation. Due to the potential risks, it is critical to pentest physical security.

### Transportation Pentesting
Transportation pentesting involves trains, airplanes, cars, buses, and trucks, including self-driven vehicles (also known as autonomous vehicles). If compromised, autonomous vehicles could be weaponized to do harm to people if successfully exploited by malicious actors. This makes this another critical technology to pentest.

### Red Team Pentesting
Red team pentesting, also known as adversarial simulation, mimics threat actors. This type of pentesting is performed in the same way that a malicious hacker or threat actor would attempt to attack a target. Red team assessments test the defenders, and typically the assessment is unannounced to the security staff and incident response (IR) personnel.
