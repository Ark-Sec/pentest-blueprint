## Vulnerability Scanning

Vulnerability scanning is often part of a pentest, but it is not required. Pentesters

can manually discover vulnerabilities without using a vulnerability scanner.
Vulnerability scanning is often a job role in a threat and vulnerability
management program. Vulnerability scanners are used to detect specific
vulnerabilities that are publicly known and for which programmers have
developed tests, and can help speed up the vulnerability discovery process.
Scheduled recurring vulnerability scanning should be part of a threat and
vulnerability management program. Vulnerability scanners are an important tool
in a pentester's toolbox, and one of the first steps in a pentest. Following are
some common vulnerability scanners:

* Nessus (www.tenable.com/products/nessus) is a vulnerability scanner by Tenable.
* Nexpose (www.rapid7.com/products/nexpose) is a vulnerability scanner offered by Rapid7, the creators of the Metasploit exploitation tool.
* Openvas (www.openvas.org) is a vulnerability scanner by Greenbone Networks, which offers a free and commercial version of Openvas.
* Qualys (www.qualys.com) offers a VMDR cloud-based vulnerability scanner. It's sold through paid subscription, and it is efficient to use, as Qualys’s own cloud handles the computing load.
