### So You Want to Be a Pentester? (https://jhalon.github.io/becoming-a-pentester/)

When dancing only causes embarrassment, give pentesting a go! Jack Halon lists a large number of useful resources that you can use to explore pentesting further. Jack also provides an overview of some of the technical skills that you'll need to have as a pentester. Web app security is very important! Chances are that today you've already used some web apps—Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, and so on. A lot of the big data breaches in the news that you'll hear about are from exploited web vulnerabilities:

* Network security encompasses securing networks of connected computers. The Internet is one massive network, but homes, offices, and industrial plants have their own internal networks as well. 
* Code review is a way to find software vulnerabilities in computer programming code. This code manifests as everything from scripts, to applications that you run in your operating system, to the operating systems themselves, and to web applications. 
* Binary reverse engineering is another way to find software vulnerabilities. Reverse engineering an application is a way to extract the code that it's made of.

Halon also covers hardware and embedded devices security. Hardware is the physical aspect of our computers and computing devices. Embedded computers are found in everything from ATMs to elevator systems, from industrial plants to vending machines. Basically, they're the computers that are inside the things we use that exist as machines that don't present themselves as computers.

Halon also covers Amazon Web Services, mobile security, and pentester education programs.

This article explains some exercises people can try when they design their own Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions. CTF is a type of hacking game where you explore an application or network to “capture” a flag, such as a script or a line of code. We explain CTF competitions in more detail in Chapter 8, “Gaining Experience."
