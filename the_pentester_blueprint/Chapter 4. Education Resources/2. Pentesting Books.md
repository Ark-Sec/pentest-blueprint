## Pentesting Books
Good books are available that address pentesting and ethical hacking. Books are good learning resources, and you can keep them on your bookshelf or phone and refer to them whenever you need to.

Here is a list of books that we recommended for expanding your pentesting education, from beginner to more advanced levels:

**Penetration Testing: A Hands-on Introduction to Hacking (No Starch Press, 2014)

In addition to explaining how to use Kali Linux for the first time and run virtual machines with vulnerable operating systems, Weidman explains how to use Nmap, Wireshark, and Burp Suite.

She describes how to conduct simulated cyberattacks involving reconnaissance, finding exploitable vulnerabilities, bypassing antivirus software, and brute forcing passwords and wireless encryption.

**Penetration Testing for Dummies

**Penetration Testing Essentials

**The hacker Playbook: Practical Guide to Penetration Testing Series.
* The Hacker Playbook: Practical Guide to Penetration Testing
* The Hacker Playbook 2: Practical Guide to Penetration Testing
* The Hacker Playbook 3: Practical Guide to Penetration Testing

Obviously, we reccomend that you read the books in order. Kim uses American football metaphors in his series. If you're an NFL fan, you'll really enjoy this. If not, maybe you'll be looking up terminology like "a play," "pregame," "drive," and "the lateral pass" on Wikipedia. That's how Kim describes the different phases of a penetration test.

**Tribe of Hackers Red Team: Tribal Knowledge from the Best in Offensive Cybersecurity

**Penetration Testing: Security Analysis

**Unauthorised Access: Physical Penetration Testing for IT Security Teams

Advanced Penetration Testing: Hacking the World's Most Secure Networks
