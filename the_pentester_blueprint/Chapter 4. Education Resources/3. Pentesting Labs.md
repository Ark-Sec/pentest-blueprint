## Pentesting Labs
Hands-on experience is the best way to learn about pentesting, and building a pentesting lab is a must for any aspiring pentester. Building a lab can be an educational experience. "Learn to build, to learn to break" is great advice! When you learn how to install a web server, for example, you gain an understanding of how it works. You learn the web server directory structure as well as the other parts of the web server. You learn how to configure security on the web server as well as to see how security configurations can be exploited. Purposely vulnerable VMs (virtual machines) can also be used in your lab.
