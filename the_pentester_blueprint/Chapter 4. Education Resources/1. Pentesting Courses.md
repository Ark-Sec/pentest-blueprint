## Pentesting Courses
Pentesting courses are offered in some colleges and universities as part of a cyber security degree or certificate program. Most learning institutions offer one or two courses. At Richland College, for instance, Ethical Hacking (pentesting class) and Web App Pentesting are currently offered. Pentesting courses are also offered at conferences and through training companies. Some consulting companies that offer pentesting services provide basic pentesting training and some even offer advanced training. Some courses are CBT (computer-based training) or online. These course options are typically self-paced.
