## Hacking Skills

Learning to hack is an important part of pentesting, and it is required to go beyond performing security vulnerability assessments. Hacking is the part of pentesting that makes it so attractive to those wanting to become pentesters. Hacking skills are best developed through hands-on experience and repetition, and as you develop your knowledge and hacking skills, you will build your base knowledge of vulnerabilities and how to exploit them. This will help you to reduce the research time required for the easier exploits and improve your efficiency. 

It's important to keep notes on how to validate and exploit vulnerabilities. Note- taking applications like OneNote, Evernote, Keepnote, and Cherry Tree make note taking and organization easier and more effective. Evernote has a web clipping function that allows you to clip sections of articles from websites and blogs. You can save the whole page or a just a section. 

You can learn hacking and pentesting in several ways. Just as with other subjects, books, websites, blogs, and courses are available. Some colleges offer pentesting courses, which are often referred to as ethical hacking courses. Conferences offer learning opportunities through talks, workshops, and preconference training. Information security groups have presentations on hacking and other security subjects. Some companies offer pentesting and ethical hacking courses, such as the SANS Institute and Cybary. Several offer online courses, making it less expensive since travel is not required. These online options are self-paced, allowing you to learn at your own pace and on your own
