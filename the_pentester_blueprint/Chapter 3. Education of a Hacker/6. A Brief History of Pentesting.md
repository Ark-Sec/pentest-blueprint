## A Brief History of Pentesting
### The Early Days of Pentesting
1974 marked the birth of what most computer scientists consider to be the first microcomputer, the Altair 8800. This was considered to be the first personal computer, in retrospect, although the term was invented by IBM in 1981 with the advent of the IBM PC. When Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs formed Apple Computers and launched the Apple I in 1976, their product helped to popularize microcomputers with computer hobbyists. Many vendors produced early microcomputers throughout the late 1970s and 1980s. These were the first computers that were practical for small offices and people's homes. In the 1980s, using a modem they could connect to early online services such as email and BBSes (bulletin board systems). 1984 was a pivotal year in the world of hacking. 2600: The Hacker Quarterly debuted in January (www.2600.com). 2600 Magazine readers would try hacks that they learned from the publication on early PCs and through early online services. 2600 Magazine is still in publication today. That same year, the first formal penetration tests were conducted by the U.S. Navy. The U.S. government started to crack down on “unlawful programmers,” and the U.S. Navy wanted to test how accessible the computers on naval bases were to external hackers via early telecommunications services.

Improving the Security of Your Site by Breaking into It Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented what was then known as the World Wide Web in 1989. It became available to the general public in August 1991, and we know it as the “web” today. People confuse the concepts of the web and the Internet. The web is simply one of many services that operate through the Internet. 

The first proper whitepaper on ethical hacking was published by Dan Farmer and Wietse Venema in 1993, titled “Improving the Security of Your Site by Breaking into It,"(fish2.com/security/admin-guide-to-cracking.html). The publication of this paper marked the genesis of penetration testing as a serious and formal area of study. 

NOTE The terms “pentesting” and “ethical hacking” have become a lot more common in the 21st century. 

Farmer and Venema encouraged pentesters to read their paper on the web. By “site,” the authors meant any online service such as a website, email server, or FTP server. Most important, the site had to be yours. You have the right to hack your own site, but you don't have the right to hack other people's sites without their permission, as that would be illegal cyberattacking. Farmer and Venema's paper established not only some of the basic methodology of pentesting, but also the pentesting ethics. These are the ethics that you must abide by in order to be an ethical hacker. 

We encourage readers of the book to read the whitepaper, which is still freely available online. It's an important historical document that will inform your philosophy as a pentester. 

Also, in 1993, Jeff Moss started the first DEFCON cybersecurity event in Las Vegas. The event grew each year, and nowadays the event attracts tens of thousands of people. Much of the discipline of ethical hacking is taught through the event, and the hundreds of similar cybersecurity events around the world are inspired by DEFCON, such as Security BSides and Blackhat.

### Pentesting Today
Nessus is the first network vulnerability scanner, a type of application you'll use a lot as a pentester. Renaud Deraison started the project in 1998. By October 2005, Tenable Network Security purchased the project and made the software proprietary and commercial (www.tenable.com). OpenVAS (www.openvas.org) developed as an open-source fork of Nessus for those who couldn't afford a Nessus license or otherwise wanted free software. Both Nessus and OpenVAS are still used frequently today. Mark Curphey founded the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) in 2001 (owasp.org). OWASP focuses on pentesting web applications specifically. This nonprofit organization now has just over a handful of employees, but well over 10,000 volunteers. OWASP develops specific web application security testing standards and offers educational programs to the general public.

H.d. Moore started the Metasploit Project in 2003. Metasploit has become another popular network vulnerability scanning platform (www.metasploit.com). Rapid7 acquired the application in October 2009. As of this writing, Metasploit is available for free in its Metasploit Framework and Metasploit Community editions, or as paid software in the Metasploit Pro edition. BackTrack was the first Linux distribution designed specifically for penetration testing (backtrack-linux.org). The first version of BackTrack was released in May 2006. By March 2013, BackTrack was superseded by Kali Linux (www.kali.org). Offensive Security still maintains and develops Kali Linux today. You'll learn more about Kali Linux in Chapter 4 and Chapter 5. The Kali Linux operating system is full of useful penetration testing applications. It's free software that you'll be expected to use as a penetration tester!
