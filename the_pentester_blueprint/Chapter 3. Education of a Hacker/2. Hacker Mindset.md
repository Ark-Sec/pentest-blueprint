## Hacker Mindset

An important part of becoming a pentester is developing the hacker, minset, which is the ability to think like a hacker and be able to find exploit vulnerabilities. The hacker mindset is a culmination of creative and analytical thinking. Developing the mindset is like learning how to troubleshoot. Installing software or hardware can be easy and straightforward, but when you run into problems and must work through those problems, you learn how to troubleshoot. 

When you find a vulnerability and try to exploit it, the exploit might not work. Not all exploits work all of the time, and you must work through the options or try other exploits. You learn to put together different exploits to help you reach the goal of the information you are trying to access. This might require admin or root level access to accomplish, or you may function just as a regular user would, but you must work through the vulnerability until you have exhausted all possibilities Not all vulnerabilities are exploitable, but you need to ensure that they can't be exploited. 

The hacker mindset takes time and repetition to develop, and it is best developed by hands-on hacking experience.
