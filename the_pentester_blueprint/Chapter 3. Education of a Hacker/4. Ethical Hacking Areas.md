## Ethical Hacking Areas

Pentesting and ethical hacking entail many different areas. You could be hacking applications, hardware, network, or even human beings! Hacking human beings is often referred to as social engineering. 

Some pentesters do a variety of types of ethical hacking, some specializing in other area or another. Following is a summary of the various areas of penetration testing.

###  Operating Systems and Applications
Pentesters can test particular installations of operating systems and the applications running within them. A wide range of software vulnerabilities are known and recorded in vulnerability collections, such as the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database. Sometimes, ethical hackers who target software can even find zero-day vulnerabilities, which are vulnerabilities that were previously unknown. People who participate in bug bounty programs are often on the hunt for zero-day vulnerabilities, and they're rewarded handsomely with large sums of money.

Vulnerabilities are dound in code all of the time. Ask any computer programmer - it's often impossible to program anything without some bugs! And sometimes bugs are actual security problems that can be exploited.

Software applications aren't the only programs that run directly on a computer. Web applications are also a common target of cyberattackers and ethical hackers alike.

### Networks
Networks are another target for pentesters. They are composed of devices such as routers, firewalls, and switches. They may test networks that are on an organization's premises, on a cloud service like Amazon Web Services (AWS), or a hybrid network (a combination of a network on a company's premises and a network on a third-party cloud service). Networks can be implemented and configured in many different many ways, and ethical hackers test all of them.

The following is a concise explanation of the different types of networks.

### Local Area Network
A local area network (LAN) is a small network that usually has fewer than 50 endpoints, and they exist in the same physical area, such as a small office or in a person's home. An endpoint is a computer that's used to interact with a network.

LANs are often found at home, so typical endpoints these days can be PCs, video game consoles, smartphones, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as Amazon Echo or Google Home smart speakers. If a LAN is deployed through Wi-Fi, it can also be called a WLAN or Wireless LAN.

### Personal Area Network
You will rarely see the term personal area network (PAN). A PAN is a LAN that's inside your home. So, in that context, PANs and LANs are the same thing.

### Wide Area Network
Wide area networks (WAN) exist when businesses and institutions connect more than one of their own LANs together. A LAN exists in one location, such as in an office. A WAN occupies multiple physical locations. So, for example, a WAN could be a company's office LAN in Toronto connected to the company's other LANs in the Dallas and Chicago offices. Because nearly everyone has a LAN at home these days, some people consider the Internet to be a massive WAN.

### Metropolitan Area Netwok
A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a term that you'll see less often. The one major difference between a WAN and a MAN is that the latter has to server a geographical area between 5 and 50 kilometers in range. If the network exists in a larger range than 50 kilometers, such as the Toronto, Dallas, Chicago example given previously, that's a WAN, not a MAN.

As we mentioned, pentesters may be called upon to test on premises, in the cloud, or on hybrid cloud networks. In the 1990s, a corporate network would typically be on a company's own premises, perhaps as a WAN or MAN, linking multiple offices. In the 21st century, companies like Amazon, Google, and Oracle started to provide their own cloud computing platforms for other businesses. That opened up an opportunity for a company's network to be entirely based on a cloud platform, or to combine the cloud with its on-premises network in what we call a hybrid network.

### Social Engineering
Phising is when a cyberattacker pretends to be a trusted entity, like someone's bank or company like Netflix, in order to maliciously acquire sensitive information.

Trojan malware pretends to be a file or application that a user wants, like a game or a photo attachment to an email, so that the victim will execute it.

Another type of social engineering attack involves contacting customers or employees through phone, email, or text while the attacker pretends to be someone else. This is a form of spoofing, otherwise known as an entity pretending to be something they're not. By pretending to be someone else, an attacker can acquire information that they have no right to have.

A pentester often has to simulate social engineering attacks to figure out if customers or employees can be fooled by cyberattackers.

### Physical Security
Physical security is a very important but often overlooked area of pentesting. Not only can computers and human beings be exploited by cyberattackers but buildings can be as well. Attackers often want to have direct physical access to the computers they'd like to exploit.

Can an unauthorized person get inside ta datacenter or server room? Can an unwelcome individual wander into an office and touch the PCs in people's cubicles? Those are sorts of problems ethical hackers of physical security try to discover in their testing. And yes, pentesting sometimes involves crawling through ducts and get into datacenters!
