## Types of Pentesting
In addition to different areas of penetration testing, there are also different types of pentesting. The different types of pentesting refer to how much knowledger the ehical hacker has of the system they're hacking before they do their work.

### Black Box Testing
in black box testing, the pentester has little to no knowledge of the system they're hacking. They truly have the perspective of an external cyberattacker. Deploying black box testing is useful for discovering if an external cyberattacker can penetrate your network or application.

A significant percentage of the cyberattacks that a real-life network faces each and every day come from ignorant external attackers. Sometimes, attackers deploy bots through the Internet, randomly looking for particular vulnerabilities to exploit. Sometimes, attackers don't have the time or motivation to do much reconnaissance work. 

The advent of the dark web and its illicit markets have made external cyberattackjs so much easier to deploy. For the cost of some cryptocurrency, potential attackers can buy exploit kits that can be used to develop malware to exploit specific systems or applications. Alternatively, for potential attackers who may have no computer programming ability whatsoever, they can buy malware that's already developed. For example, such individuals can purchase ransomware that maliciously encrypts data storage with the decryption key outside of the victims' hands, demanding a ransom payment for file recovery. Illicit cryptocurrency miners can use a tiny bit of computer processing power on a large number of CPUs in order to make an attacker money. Lots of other types of malware and exploits can be purchased on the dark web as well.

Because external cyberattacks are easier than ever to deploy, the information that a pentester can acquire through black box testing is really valuable.

### White Box Testing
Whereas black box testing is done with little to no knowledge of the system being tested, white box testing is accomplished with pentesters having a lot of knowledge of what they're testing.

White box testing is done with little to no knowledge of the system being tested, white box testing is accomplished with pentesters having a lot of knowledge of what they're testing.

White box testers know all sorts of information about the system they're testing. They know which specific hardware and devices they're targeting, down to their particular models and configurations. They know which particular operating systems are being used, and which particular applications are being run on them. They also know identifying information like IP addresses, routers, and other networking details. Sometimes, they may even have the source code for the applications that they're testing.

Internal cyberattacks are definitely a huge thing. They are often deployed by disgruntled employees and contractors. These people frequently have user accounts with the networks that they intend to cyberattack. Moreover, they usually have knowledge of the systems that they want to attack, which can only be acquired by being an employed by the organizations they intend to attack. Their technical knowledge could be very advanced indeed!

White box testers simulate the role of an internal cyberattacker. And sometimes, white box testers have a better idea of which particular vulnerabilities to test for their exploitative weakness.

### Gray Box Testing
You probably know that if you mic black and white paint, you get gray paint. So, if you assume that gray box testing is a mix of black box and white box testing, you'd be absolutely correct.

A gray box tester may know which operating systems are in the network and what kinds of devices are on it, but little else. Or, they may know a web application was built with Joomla, but they might not know much else about it. In a nutshell, a gray box tester knows more than a black box tester, but less than a white box tester.

Gray box testing simulates an external cyberattacker who has gained illegitimate access to an organization's network infrastructure documents or has otherwise done some degree of reconnaissance of their target.
