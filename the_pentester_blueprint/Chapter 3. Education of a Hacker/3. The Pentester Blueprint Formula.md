## The Pentester Blueprint Formula

To become a pentester, you must understand the technologies and security of the targets that you are hacking, and you must have the hacker mindset. These three elements make up the Pentester Blueprint. A common mistake of many aspiring pentesters is to underestimate the importance of technology.
