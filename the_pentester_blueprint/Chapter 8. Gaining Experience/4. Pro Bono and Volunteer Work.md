Pro bono and volunteer work are also options for gaining experience. Some nonprofit organizations cannot afford pentests, so this can open up opportunities to get pentesting experience. Schools, churches, and charitable organizations are some organizations to consider. 

Even if you're working as a volunteer, you must be extra careful to ensure that you and the party who owns the network that you're testing have a legal agreement about what you're allowed to do and not allowed to do. All pentests work within a legally agreed-upon framework. Otherwise, you're just cyberattacking!
