There is some debate about what the world's first bug bounty program was. Steve Morgan of Cybersecurity Ventures believes that the very first bug bounty program was offered by Hunter & Ready all the way back in 1983! It was for the VRTX embedded operating system, and the winner would receive a Volkswagen Beetle, colloquially known as a “Bug.” Or, they could have just accepted the $1,000 prize, which was a lot more money back then! 

The first proper bug bounty program launched on October 10, 1995, for the Netscape Navigator 2.0 web browser beta. At the time, Netscape's Matt Horner said: 

By rewarding users for quickly identifying and reporting bugs back to us, this program will encourage an extensive, open review of Netscape Navigator 2.0 and will help us to continue to create products of the highest quality. 

Despite the success of the program, bug bounty programs had yet to catch on. 

The next proper bug bounty program didn't launch until 2002, done for IDefense® Security Intelligence, now part of Accenture (www.accenture.com/us-en/service-idefense-security-intelligence). 

We all know that a lot of former Netscape developers and Netscape code went on to Mozilla and the Firefox web browser. By 2004, Mozilla offered its first bug bounty program for the browser with top prizes of $500. 

The frequency and availability of bug bounty programs exploded from there, as did the size of the money rewards. Many other developers got into the game, and the amount of money involved grew as well. The largest bug bounty prize available in 2020 is offered by Apple—$200,000 for identifying critical firmware vulnerabilities! So, if you have enough money to live on for a year without needing additional income, you could take the year off to find Apple firmware vulnerabilities, assuming you'll find one that Apple considers worthy of the $200,000 in that time. If you're that confident, do it! 

But don't quit your day job to participate in most bug bounties. Typical money rewards are in the $1,000–$10,000 range.
