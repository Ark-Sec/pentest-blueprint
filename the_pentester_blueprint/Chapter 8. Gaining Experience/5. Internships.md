Internships are often used by college students to get on-the-job experience. Sometimes, they can even turn into a permanent job. Internships can be paid or unpaid, but either way they offer valuable work experience.

If you'd like to do an internship, we strongly recommend seaching "Pentester internship" on LinkedIn or Google. The last time we checked, lots of search results came up.

If there is a hacker lab or computer science program near you live, we would also recommend asking about internships within those spaces. Make sure that you have a resume or CV that describes all of your current computing experience, even if you consider it to be insignificant!
