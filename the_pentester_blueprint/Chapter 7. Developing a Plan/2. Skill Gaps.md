So, whatever your professional background,you likely have at least a few of the skills that could be useful to a career in pentesting. Nonetheless, there will also be all kinds of skills and knowledge that you'll lack, no matter what. There's nothing wrong with that—even the authors of this book learn something new every day about computer technology or life in general. Always be a lifelong learner! 

It will help you on your journey to becoming a pentester to figure out which skills you lack, so that you can work on developing them. Chapters 2, 3, 4, and 6 explained thoroughly the various skills and knowledge that pentesters are expected to have, so you can use that as your guide to pinpoint what you need to acquire. Table 7.1 is also an excellent starting point for taking stock of your skills and pinpointing any gaps. 

While we're here, we should let you know about a matter that people in the cybersecurity industry love to talk about. Both employers and people who work in the industry often talk about a cybersecurity skills gap. Employers often say that potential job applicants lack the required skills in the roles that they are trying to fill, whereas people who actually work in the industry talk about how employers look for unicorns; that is, people with combinations of skills and experience virtually no one has. 

Sometimes, people who work in the industry notice that job postings have impossible requirements like “must have 20 years of experience with Windows Server 2016,” so they can find a legal loophole to recruit an offshore job candidate for much lower pay. 

Another matter is employers wanting employees to assume the full cost and burden of training. In previous decades, employers were more likely to invest in their employees by covering the cost of training courses and paying employees their wages or salary while they learned to do the work they would begin once they completed their training. Though sometimes employers still invest money and time on training programs, anecdotally fewer do these days. 

We implore you to prepare yourself to acquire all of the skills and experience that you'll need to be hired in a pentesting role. Nevertheless, in our opinion, it would be beneficial if more employers would do more to address any apparent “skills gaps” at their own expense. Sometimes, the term “skills gap” can be quite controversial in the cybersecurity industry!
