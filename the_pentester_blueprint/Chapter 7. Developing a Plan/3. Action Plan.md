So, you know which skills you already have and which skills you need to work on. It's time to formulate an action plan! 

If you've never worked with computers professionally before, you should focus on the general beginner IT skills and certifications that we discussed in Chapter 2. CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+, and Linux+ certifications are very useful to have. They'll give you a foundational understanding of how the computer systems that you'll be pentesting work. You'll also find that having those certifications is useful as you move on to more advanced certifications that are specific to ethical hacking. 

While you're at home using your own equipment, give your general IT skills a try. Install operating systems directly onto your own computers or within VMs. Go into your OS settings and try a variety of different configurations. We also recommend that you try installing VMs running server operating systems like Windows Server and Red Hat. There are all kinds of advanced applications there, like Active Directory for administrating Windows clients. If you have a wired printer, try connecting it to your home LAN through Wi-Fi instead. If your printer is connected through Wi-Fi, try a wired USB connection instead. See if you can get the various computers, peripherals, video game consoles, and Internet of Things devices in your home LAN to work with each other. 

If you're moving from another IT role to an ethical hacking career, you can focus on the certifications that are mentioned in Chapter 6, “Certifications and Degrees.” The Certified Ethical Hacker, PenTest+, and OSCP certifications are a good to start. Read books, do research online, and enroll in programs that will help you prepare for those certification exams. While you're at it, build a pentesting lab, as described in Chapter 5, “Building a Pentesting Lab.” Before you take a single exam, you can practice simulating cyberattacks in virtual machines, in virtual networks, and on your own computers and mobile devices. 

As you acquire the various skills that you'll need as a pentester, you'll need to gain experience and find employment. Chapter 8, “Gaining Experience,” will describe various ways that you can get experience that will increase your chances of landing a job. Chapter 9, “Getting Employed as a Pentester,” has lots of tips for finding employment as a pentester. Not everyone who tries to enter the field has a solid idea of how to do so successfully, so hopefully our tips and what you'll learn from the stories of actual pentesters throughout this book will give you a major advantage!
