## Hacking Tergets
To develop hacking skills, you need targets to attack. Obviously, attacking other people's computers without their permission is a massive, illegal no-no. Instead, you can build your own vulnerable systems, which is a very educational experience. If you don't have the time to do this, however, you can download vulnerable VMs for your lab.

### PentestBox
PentestBox (pentestbox.org) is a wonderful free pentesting target on which you can test your ethical hacking skills. PentestBox can be especially useful as a testing environment because it's designed to run directly in Windows without the memory and CPU requirement of a virtual machine. It can also spare you the hassle of switching between operating systems on a multiboot computer. A multiboot computer has more than one operating system directly installed on its hard drive, with a different partition for each operating system. 

PentestBox allows you to run malware and other simulated cyberattacks while sandboxing them from the Windows operating system that's directly installed on your computer. Give it a try! 

PentestBox is a convenient system on which to run experiments because you can install it directly in Windows without having to run it in a virtualization client like Oracle VirtualBox.

### VulnHub
VulnHub (www.vulnhub.com) is a large and growing collection of vulnerable VMs that you can install in virtualization clients like VirtualBox or VMWare. Contributors create operating systems and applications with particular vulnerabilities that you can find. The last time we checked, there were hundreds of different VMs that you can try on your own computer through this website. This resource is definitely worth checking out for its variety of ethical hacking targets.

### Proving Grounds
Offensive Security has its own virtual pentesting network, Proving Grounds, which you can try to hack (www.offensive-security.com/labs). Proving Grounds includes a modern Windows domain structure, Linux production environments, Active Directory (for administrating Windows clients), and attack simulations, such as file server attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, privilege escalation, and buffer overflow attacks. Keep in mind that Proving Grounds is a paid service. If you truly want to become a professional ethical hacker, however, Proving Grounds Teams Edition can be a worthwhile investment if you share the expense with friends who are also learning about penetration testing. It's definitely something that's worth checking out.
