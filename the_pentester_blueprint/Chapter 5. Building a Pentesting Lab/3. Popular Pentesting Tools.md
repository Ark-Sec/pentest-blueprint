## Popular Pentesting Tools

There are thousands of different applications that pentesters use. Which applications you use will depend on the types of networks, computers, and applications that you will be ethically hacking. The following is a summary of some of the most common applications that pentesters use.

### Kali Linux
Kali Linux is perhaps the most fundamental pentesting tool available. It's a complete free operating system that you can install directly on your PC or run as a live DVD without installing it on your hard drive. You should definitely visit the Kali website to download a disc image that you can burn onto a blank DVD (www.kali.org). 

Some of the tools that are already installed in Kali include Nmap, Wireshark, Sparta, Metasploit Framework, Maltego Teeth, and WebSlayer. Kali Linux has many, many more tools, and it may take you years to explore all of them fully. As we explain in Chapter 6, “Certifications and Degrees,” Offensive Security, developer of Kali Linux and certification authority for OSCP, has its own certifications that are specifically geared toward using Kali Linux professionally.

### Nmap
Nmap (nmap.org) stands for network mapper. If you run Nmap on a network that you're testing, you can see how it was designed and how it operates. Nmap includes host discovery for seeing which network services servers run, port scanning to see which TCP/IP network ports are running on those servers, and operating system detection so that you can see which OS servers and clients are in use on the network.

### Wireshark
Wireshark (www.wireshark.org) is a packet analyzer. Packets are the sections of data that computers send to each other through a network. All data sent through a network is sent in the form of packets. For instance, when you run a web browser on your PC, your PC (the client) sends packets to a web server requesting a web page and then the web server sends your client packets containing the data that makes up the web pages you visit. With Wireshark, you can see what those packets contain if they aren't encrypted! If an online service was foolish enough not to encrypt your financial data when you buy something online, a cyberattacker could use Wireshark to see your credit card number. Scary stuff, eh?

### Vulnerability Scanning Applications
Metasploit Framework, Nessus, and OpenVAS are all network vulnerability scanning pplications:

www.metasploit.com
www.tenable.com
www.openvas.org

In these programs, you can configure your computer to try exploits for specific operating systems, web applications, and the applications that are run on client machines and servers. If any of the exploits work, you have then found known vulnerabilities that you can report as a pentester. A common misconception is that pentesting is just running these network vulnerability scanning applications. However, a network vulnerability scan is just one part of a proper pentest. Plus, there's some work and professional knowledge that's needed just to use a network vulnerability scanning application properly! Nothing about pentesting is as simple as it looks.

### Hak5
Hak5 (shop.hak5.org) makes a number of different devices that are designed for pentesting. Shark Jack (shop.hak5.org/products/shark-jack) can be plugged into a network to run thorough reconnaissance on it. USB Rubber Ducky (shop.hak5.org/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe) can be used to install backdoors and acquire sensitive data like usernames and passwords. (It's not as cute as it sounds!) Wi-Fi Pineapple (shop.hak5.org/products/wifi- pineapple) can be used to exploit vulnerable wireless networks. Hak5 has many more physical devices that can be very dangerous in the hands of a cyberattacker but very useful in the hands of an ethical hacker.
