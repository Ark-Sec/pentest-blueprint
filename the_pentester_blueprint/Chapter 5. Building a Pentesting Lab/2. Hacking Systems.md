## Hacking Systems
A pentester uses a computer to perform pentests and hack targets. You can install hacking tools directly on your computer or in virtual machines. You can find preinstalled tools on pentesting Linux distributions or scripts like the Pen Tester Framework (PTF) by TrustedSec (www.trustedsec.com), and you can install pentesting tools on Windows using FireEye's Commando VM (Virtual Machine) script (github.com/fireeye/commando-vm).

As you know, operating systems are the software that your computer needs in order to run applications. Examples of operating systems include Windows or macOS on your computer, or iOS or Android on your smartphone. We will be describing Kali Linux, an operating system that was specifically designed for penetration testing.

What's a virtual machine (VM)? Instead of just running directly on a physical computer, an operating system can also run as an application within another operating system. You need a computer with an operating system, and then you need software for running operating systems as applications. For that, you'll need virtualization software, such as Oracle VirtualBox (www.virtualbox.org). Let's say, for example, that you are running Windows on your PC. You can install VirtualBox in Windows, and then Install macOS in Virtualbox. Basically, you can configure VirtualBox to pretend that it's a Mac and run macOS on it. That's the wonder of virtualization.

You can execute malware in virtual machines.
