## Pentesting Lab Options

### Minimalist Lab
This option is less costly and requires less electricity to operate. It can be a single computer running multiple VMs. The attacking system OS can be the host OS, or you can use a VM dedicated to hacking with target VMs to hack. This option could be set up on a laptop, which would make your lab portable.

A portable lab allows you to study in different locations. Sometimes, changing study location allows you to study longer. Changing up your study environment can also help hold your interest longer. A portable lab allows you to study at work on your lunch break or to take it with if you must travel.

An ideal minimalist lab could be just a laptop computer with Kali Linux installed on it. The laptop provides portability, so you can test physical networks on the go. Kali Linux contains hundreds of different pentesting applications. Your most frequently used applications would probably be Metasploit Framework for network vulnerability testing, Wireshark for packet analysis, and Nmap, so that you can look at how the various networks to which you connect are configured. There's also a Wi-Fi cracking suite that includes Aircrack-NG and a few other apps, which is useful for whenever you need to test WEP or WPA2-protected wireless networks and a USB thumb drive for putting files onto computers or taking files from them.


### Dedicated Lab
This option is the next step up from the minimalist lab. For a dedicated lab, you have separate computers for your attacking system and the hacking target system. This option adds a networking element to your lab because the target systems and the attacking system are not contained on a single device. You can have more than one computer for your hacking targets.

Your dedicated lab will likely be a desktop or laptop PC with Kali Linux installed on it that you keep in your own office most of the time. In addition to USB thumb drives and Ethernet cables, you will also have your own ISP service, which you can use for testing networks remotely through the Internet. It may be more useful to work from your own location when you don't need direct physical access to the network that you're testing, and you need to run applications such as network vulnerability scanners for more than eight hours at a time. Your dedicated lab will enable you to perform tasks that would take longer to finish than your laptop's battery can handle on one charge if you're on the go with your minimalist lab.


### Advanced Lab
This is the most expensive of the three options, and it requires the most electricity. This option is more complex to configure, and it takes more to maintain.

If you run into problems with your lab, it can be time-consuming to troubleshoot. The benefit of this option is the learning opportunities. Configuring and networking multiple systems is a great learning experience, and the advanced lab option can be as complex as you desire. With this option, you would build an attack system and hack target systems. and the attack and target systems are networked together. You can use routers and switches, which can be separate hardware devices or virtual using Pfsense (www.pfsense.org), an open-source firewall software distribution based on the FreeBSD UNIX-like operating system.

An advanced lab can include a laptop with Kali Linux that you take with you when you travel, a laptop or desktop PC with Kali Linux parked in your office with your own ISP connection, and some extras. The extras can include routers, switches, or Pfsense; some Hak5 devices, such as a Shark Jack and a Wi-Fi Pineapple; and a virtualization client, such as Oracle VirtualBox. There are multiple uses for your virtualization client. You can install VMs of operating systems on which you can test malware, and you can install vulnerable disc images from places like VulnHub to try to exploit specific vulnerabilities. Virtual machines are explained in the next section.
