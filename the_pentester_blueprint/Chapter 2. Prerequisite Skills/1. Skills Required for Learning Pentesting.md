## Skills Required for Learning Pentesting

### Operating Systems
An operating system (OS) is required for the operation of systems including
computers, servers, network devices, and mobile devices, such as mobile phones
and tablets. Windows and Linux are two of the most widely used operating
systems.
Linux is a UNIX-like OS that is widely used on the Internet, mobile devices, and

network hardware. IoT devices use Linux as an OS. Several different versions of
Linux are available, known as Linux distributions, or “distros.” Linux is a
popular pentesting OS, with Kali Linux and Parrot OS being two of the most
common versions in use for pentesting. System administrator–level skills in
these OSs should be your goal.
Here are some common Linux distributions:
* Debian
* Ubuntu
* Red Hat Linux
* CentOS
* Arch Linux
* Mint

Windows is the most frequently used desktop OS, and it’s very commonly used
for servers in businesses large and small. Windows environments can get very
complex. Active Directory (AD) makes user and security administration more
manageable, especially in large IT environments. AD knowledge is an important
component in learning Windows and the Windows networking OS. Start out by
learning the Windows OS and then advance to AD. System administrator–level
knowledge will give you the skills that you need to pentest Windows
environments, and being able to exploit AD accounts can give you access to
multiple computers and servers.
System administrator, or sysadmin, skills for Windows and Linux should be your
goal. Sysadmins don't rely on a graphical user interface (GUI) to manage
systems, but they know how to use it. As a pentester it is important to have the
ability to access and manipulate systems from the command line since initial
access to the system may only be available at the command line or through a
terminal.
Firewalls can be shut down from the command line if the pentester has the
necessary security permissions. Also, network settings and other system
functions can be changed from the command line. Pentesters can run scripts
from the command line. Python, Perl, and Ruby are common languages on
Linux systems, and they can be used on Windows as well. Windows PowerShell
scripts are very powerful for administering and pentesting Windows-based
systems. System configuration mistakes, including network, OS, and software,

are a major threat vector exploited by malicious actors, and understanding them
will help you as a pentester.

#### Networking
Websites, IoT, and mobile devices make up our modern, connected world.
Included in IoT are your connected home devices and devices used to monitor
and track commercial applications. Cellular networks connect mobile phones
and devices where phone and data communication lines are not available.
Networks, both wired and wireless, provide a threat vector that can be exploited
by threat actors to access devices and sensitive information, so it is important
that networks be assessed. Pentesters use attacker techniques, and therefore
networking skills are required.

### Information Security
Pentesters need to understand security, and this skill is needed to be successful as
a pentester. This is part of the basic prerequisites for your job. To hack a system,
you need to understand the technology of the target as well as the security. Weak
security configurations are one of the main reasons why systems get hacked.

### Prerequisites Learning
It is important to learn prerequisite skills prior to learning about pentesting. Your
time will be well spent, and it will pay off when you start to learn pentesting
techniques and throughout your pentesting career. There are a lot of learning
options, but following is a quick guide using CompTIA certification-based
learning resources as an example.

### A+
A+ is a good starting point for your base technology knowledge. A+ covers OSs
for mobile devices to computer OSs including Windows, MacOS, Linux, and
Android. It also covers hardware, basic IT infrastructure, and networking.

### Network+
Network+ teaches routers and switches in the network hardware device
coverage. Network+ covers network protocols, standards, and security, as well as
network virtualization.

### Linux+
Linux+ covers Linux administration for computers, servers, web applications,
and mobile devices. Linux+ covers some of the most commonly used Linux
distributions.

### Security+
Security+ focuses on techniques in risk management, risk mitigation, threat
management, and intrusion detection. Security+ covers IT auditor and pentester
job roles in addition to system administrator, network administrator, and security
administrator roles.
While other resources can be used, the CompTIA-based resources give you an
idea of what you need to study to obtain the prerequisites needed by aspiring
pentesters. A good resource for videos containing CompTIA learning content is

recommended for studying for the CompTIA certifications.
