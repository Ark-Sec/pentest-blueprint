## Pentesting Certifications
You have options when it comes to pentesting, and some non-pentesting certifications could still be helpful for aspiring pentesters. Some certifications are well-known with pentesting while others are not. The well-known certifications are typically the ones with which human resources and management are familiar. These pentesting certifications are what we refer to as entry-level credentials.


### Entry-Level Certifications
#### Certified Ethical Hacker
EC-Council's Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification is one of the first ethical hacking certifications and probably one of the most useful ones for finding a job as a pentester. The CEH is a Department of Defense (DoD)– recognized certification, and it is part of the DoD Directive 8570 certifications.

The CEH can be helpful in getting government contracts. 

EC-Council prefers that you have two years of pentesting experience before taking the exam, but you can get a lot of that experience from simulating cyberattacks on virtual machines, virtualized networks, and your own devices, as described in Chapter 5, “Building a Pentesting Lab.” As of 2020, the current version of the CEH is v10. When taking the exam, you are given four hours to conduct your 125-question exam in a supervised environment and, at the time of this writing, it costs $1,199 USD to take. Here are the modules on the exam to get you started:

* Introduction to Ethical Hacking
* Footprinting and Reconnaissance
* Scanning Networks
* Enumeration
* Vulnerability Analysis
* System Hacking
* Malware Threats
* Sniffing
* Social Engineering
* Denial-of-Service
* Session Hijacking
* Evading IDS, Firewalls, and Honeypots
* Hacking Web Applications
* SQL Injection
* Hacking Wireless Networks
* Hacking Mobile Platforms
* IoT Hacking
* Cloud Computing
* Cryptography


#### PenTest+
CompTIA's A+ and Network+ were some of the first IT certifications (www.comptia.org). Though EC-Council has a number of certifications that are specific to cybersecurity, CompTIA is the vendor-neutral certification body that's probably best known for covering all of the major areas of IT in general. 

Given the increasing demand for experienced penetration testers, CompTIA created the PenTest+ certification and launched it on July 31, 2018. It is one of the newest pentest certifications. The PenTest+ learning materials do a great job of covering pentesting methodology and pentesting itself. PenTest+ is a great starting point for those wanting to learn about pentesting. 

If you're working on your EC-Council CEH, it would probably be a good idea to get this certification, too. But if the CEH's $1,199 price tag is a bit overwhelming for you, you can go for the PenTest+ certification first. It's relatively inexpensive at $359 USD, at the time of this writing. You will be given 165 minutes in a supervised environment to answer a maximum of 85 questions on the exam. There are no mandatory prerequisites, but it's recommended that you have a CompTIA Security+ certification and three or four years of information security experience.

#### eLearn Security Junior Penetration Tester
The eLearn Security Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT) certification is offered by eLearn Security (www.elearnsecurity.com). eLearn Security certifications and learning content are online, hands-on material. The eJPT, as well as other eLearn Security offerings, require a practical exam including a pentest to be conducted as part of the exam process. eLearn Security certifications may not be as widely known as some others, but they have great learning content.


### Intermediate-Level Certifications
#### Offensive Security Certified Professional
The Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certification is the product of Offensive Security, a pentest consulting firm and the creator of the popular Kali Linux penetration testing operating system (www.offensive- security.com/pwk-oscp). The certification exam requires that you take a 24- hour practical pentest exam. To pass, you must hack into targets on the network and must score 75 or higher. This certification is highly sought after by companies who are hiring pentesters.

As a pentester, you'll hear about Offensive Security a lot. The organization is also a certification body, and it offers many certifications that can be useful in your pentesting career. The Offensive Security Certified Professional is probably the first certification you'll want to get, but only go for it after you've acquired EC-Council's CEH, CompTIA's PenTest+, or both, as the OSCP is an intermediate certification, rather than a beginner one. 

Penetration Testing with Kali Linux is where you should start. It's Offensive Security's own course to prepare you for the OSCP exam. The course covers the following topics:
* Getting Comfortable with Kali Linux
* Command Line Fun
* Practical Tools
* Bash Scripting
* Passive Information Gathering
* Active Information Gathering
* Vulnerability Scanning
* Web Application Attacks
* Introduction to Buffer Overflows
* Windows Buffer Overflows
* Linux Buffer Overflows
* Client-Side Attacks
* Locating Public Exploits
* Fixing Exploits
* File Transfers
* Antivirus Evasion
* Privilege Escalation
* Password Attacks
* Port Redirection and Tunneling
* Active Directory Attacks
* The Metasploit Framework
* PowerShell Empire
* Assembling the Pieces: Penetration Test Breakdown
* Trying Harder: The Labs

Offensive Security lets you buy the PWK course and the OSCP exam at the same time. At the time of this writing, the course and exam combination is $999 with 30 days of lab access, $1,199 with 60 days of lab access, and $1.349 with 90 days of lab access. You can sign up for these packages on Offensive Security's website.

#### GIAC Penetration Tester
Training for the GIAC Penetration Tester (GPEN) certification is offered by the SANS Institute (pen-testing.sans.org/certification/gpen) and the exam governing body is GIAC (www.giac.org/certification/penetration- tester-gpen). This is a hands-on class that teaches students the tools, techniques, and methodologies used by pentesters. The content is created and taught by some of the most well-known experts in the field. The exam for this certification is a proctored, question-based exam. This certification is highly sought after by companies who are hiring pentesters.


### Advanced-Level Certifications
#### Offensive Security Certified Expert
If you have your CEH, PenTest+, and Offensive Security's OSCP certification, what's next? Why don't you go for the Offensive Security Certified Expert certification, Offensive Security's most advanced pentesting exam? It's a real challenge! The Offensive Security Certified Expert (OSCE) certification (www.offensive- security.com/ctp-osce) is from Offensive Security, like the OSCP. The OSCE content teaches advanced pentesting skills and exploit development. Like the OSCP, the OSCE exam uses a practical lab exam that requires pentesting and exploit writing. It is a 48-hour exam. This certification is highly sought after by companies who are hiring pentesters. Cracking the Perimeter is Offensive Security's course to prepare you for the OSCE exam. Here are some of the topics that it covers:
* Cross Site Scripting Attacks
* Directory Traversal / LFI Attacks
* Backdooring PE Files
* Advanced Exploitation Techniques
* ASLR
* Egghunters
* Exploit Writing (Zero-Day Approach)
* Attacking Network Infrastructure
* Bypassing Cisco Access Lists Using Spoofed SNMP Requests
* Sniffing Remote Traffic via GRE tunnels
* Compromising Router Configs

You absolutely should have your OSCP before you even consider the OSCE. The OSCE, however, could give you a real edge in being hired as a pentester! As with the OSCP, you can buy the Cracking the Perimeter course and the OSCE exam at the same time. The cost with 30-day lab access is $1,200, and with 60- day lab access, the cost is $1,500. Everything you need to know is on Offensive Security's website.

#### GIAC Exploit Researcher and Advanced Penetration Tester
The GIAC Exploit Researcher and Advanced Penetration Tester (GXPN) is offered by the SANS Institute, and it is an advanced pentesting skills certification (www.sans.org/course/advanced-penetration-testing- exploits-ethical-hacking). The certification is similar to the OSCE, and it teaches exploit development and advanced pentesting. The exam for this certification is a proctored, question-based exam. This certification is highly sought after by companies who are hiring pentesters.

### Specialization Web Application Pentesting Certifications
#### GIAC Web Application Penetration Tester (GWAPT) is a web application pentesting certification offered by the SANS institute.
(www.sans.org/course/web-app-penetration-testing-ethical-hacking).

The exam is a proctored, question-based exam. This certification is highly sought after by companies who are hiring pentesters.

#### eLearn Security Web Application Penetration Testing
The eLearn Security Web Application Penetration Testing (eWAPT) certification (www.elearnsecurity.com/certification/ewpt) is offered by eLearn Security, and it requires that you pass a practical pentest exam like the other eLearn Security certification exams.

#### Offensive Security Web Expert

So now you have your OSCP certification, and you really want to specialize in hacking websites and web applications. You may want to study for the Offensive Security Web Expert Certification next. The web is a big part of our everyday lives, and it is significant cyberattack surface! So, OSWE could be a useful specialization to have.

The Offensive Security Web Expert (OSWE) certification is offered by Offensive Security, and it is an advanced web application pentesting certification (www.offensive-security.com/awae-oswe). The course used to prepare for this certification is Advanced Web Attacks and Exploitation (AWAE). It’s Offensive Security’s course to prepare you for the OSWE exam. Donovan Cheah wrote about his experience with the AWAE course on his blog:

“The AWAE incorporates different programming languages, databases, and web application vulnerabilities. The web vulnerability classes include blind SQL injections, cross-site scripting, and deserialization. Throughout the course, scripting skills are emphasized. Exploits aren't good enough; we sometimes try harder by automating them. Be comfortable in a scripting language of your choice. Python is excellent since the course is in Python, but it is alright to use another scripting language of your choice.

Since this course is a white box penetration testing course, it introduces different methods of debugging, such as simply writing console.log() statements to print output in JavaScript and dynamic debugging in .NET with dnSpy (dnSpy is awesome; even if you don't plan to take the AWAE, take some time to reverse engineer a .NET application). A white box penetration tester must be familiar with walking through code execution flows with the help of a debugger. The AWAE will be about 50% of the time on a debugger, about 20% of the time spent scripting, and if you try harder, 30% on the extra miles and other research.”

As is Offensive Security's style, you can buy the AWAE course and the OSWE exam at the same time from its website. At the time of this writing, with 30-day lab access, the fee is $1,400; with 60-day lab access, it's $1600; and with 90-day lab access, it's $1,800.

### Wireless Pentesting Certifications
#### Offensive Security Wireless Professional
Once you have your OSCP, you may choose to specialize in hacking wireless networks. Wireless networks are a big deal these days! They exist everywhere from your home WLAN to big corporate offices. They present a massive cyberattack surface that can penetrate mobile devices, PCs, and servers alike. 

Offensive Security Wireless Attacks (WiFu) is Offensive Security's pentesting and certification course to prepare you for the Offensive Security Wireless Professional (OSWP) exam (www.offensive-security.com/wifu-oswp). Like the other Offensive Security certification exams, this one is a practical, hands- on, lab-based exam.

There are some of the many topics that are covered in the WiFu course:
* IEEE 802.11
